# Greek Cities and Villages Geolocation Dataset

## Overview

The "Greek Cities and Villages Geolocation Dataset" is an open dataset that contains information about the population, geolocation, and administrative divisions of cities and villages in Greece. It aims to provide useful data for geographic, demographic, and administrative analysis. The dataset includes details at various administrative levels, such as regions, sub-regions, and municipalities.

## Contents

The dataset includes the following columns:

- **`country`**: The country where the city or village is located. In this dataset, all entries correspond to "Greece."

- **`section`**: Broad geographical section of Greece, such as "Βορεια Ελλαδα" (Northern Greece), "Νησιά Αιγαίου" (Aegean Islands), etc.

- **`region`**: The administrative region within Greece. Greece is divided into 13 administrative regions, each of which includes several sub-regions or prefectures.

- **`sub_region`**: The smaller administrative division within the region, known as the "peripheral unit" (Περιφερειακή Ενότητα).

- **`municipality`**: The local government area, representing the third level of administrative division.

- **`city`**: The name of the city, town, or village.

- **`population`**: The population of the city or village, based on the latest demographic research.

- **`latitude`**: The geographic latitude of the location.

- **`longitude`**: The geographic longitude of the location.

- **`has_geolocation`**: A boolean value indicating whether the geolocation (latitude and longitude) is available for the specific entry.

- **`settlement_type`**: The type of settlement based on the population:
    - `"χωριό"` (village) for populations of 2,000 or fewer.
    - `"κωμόπολη"` (small town) for populations greater than 2,000 and up to 10,000.
    - `"πόλη"` (city) for populations greater than 10,000 and up to 100,000.
    - `"μεγάλη_πόλη"` (large city) for populations greater than 100,000.

## Data Source

The population data in this dataset is based on the latest demographic research conducted by the Hellenic Statistical Authority (ELSTAT) in 2021. Geolocation coordinates are derived from open geospatial data sources to provide accurate latitude and longitude for each location.
