# Greek Cities and Villages Geolocation Dataset

## Overview

The "Greek Cities and Villages Geolocation Dataset" is an open dataset that contains information about the population, geolocation, and administrative divisions of cities and villages in Greece. It aims to provide useful data for geographic, demographic, and administrative analysis. The dataset includes details at various administrative levels, such as regions, sub-regions, and municipalities.

## Contents

The dataset includes the following columns:

- **`country`**: The country where the city or village is located. In this dataset, all entries correspond to "Greece."
